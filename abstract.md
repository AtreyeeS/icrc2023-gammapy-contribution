[{"insert":"# Gammapy - present status and future roadmap\n\n### Authors: A. Sinha, R. Terrier, A. Donath, B. Khelifi, Q. Remy .... for the gammapy dev team\n\nSince the first release of Gammapy v0.1 in 2014, this light weight open source python library has come a long way to \nbecome a popular data analysis package for high energy astrophysics. Selected as the official CTA Science tools, it is also \nan approved analysis tool within the H.E.S.S. and MAGIC collaborations. The first long-term version, Gammapy v1.0 was released \nlast year, which is compliant with several well-established data conventions in high-energy astrophysics, \nand provides serialised data products that are interoperable with other softwares.\n\nEvent lists and instrument response functions at the common \"DL3\" format from various instruments \ncan be reduced to data binned in energy and time coordinates. With this binned data, \nthe flux and morphology of one or more Î³-ray sources can be estimated using Poisson maximum likelihood fitting and \nassuming a variety of spectral, temporal and spatial models. Estimation of flux points, likelihood profiles\nand light curves is also supported. Complex user defined likelihoods and models can also be implemented.\n\nIn this contribution we will highlight the main features of Gammapy v1.0, including data reduction and analysis examples\nfrom different space and ground based instruements, applications of various background rejection techniques,\nand a simulateneous fitting across multiple instruments with astrophysical models. We will also present our plans for the future,\nwith new features, improved API with distributed computing for scalable analysis,\nand enhanced support for all sky instruments like Fermi-LAT and HAWC. \n\n"}]
